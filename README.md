## Provisional abstract

Control of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis relies on mass administration of praziquantel. Whilst these programmes have reduced infection prevalence and intensity, their impact on parasite transmission and evolution is poorly understood. Here we examine the genomic impact of repeated mass drug administration on *Schistosoma mansoni* populations that show reduced praziquantel efficacy. We sequenced whole-genomes of 198 *S. mansoni* larvae from 34 Ugandan children from regions with differing praziquantel exposure. Parasites infecting children from Lake Victoria, a transmission hotspot, form a diverse panmictic population. A single round of treatment did not reduce this diversity and there has been no apparent population contraction caused by long-term praziquantel use. We find evidence of positive selection acting on members of gene families previously implicated in praziquantel action, but detect no high frequency functionally impactful variants. As efforts to eliminate schistosomiasis intensify, our study provides a foundation for genomic surveillance of this major human parasite.
