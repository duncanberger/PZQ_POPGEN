## Abstract

Control strategies targeting the parasitic disease schistosomiasis rely on mass drug administration (MDA) using praziquantel. Whilst these programmes have been effective at reducing infection prevalence and intensity, their impact on parasite transmission and evolution is poorly understood. Here we examine the genomic impact of repeated MDA on *Schistosoma mansoni* populations with evidence of reduced praziquantel efficacy. Whole-genomes of 198 *S. mansoni* larvae were sequenced from 34 Ugandan children from regions with differing praziquantel exposure. Parasites infecting children from Lake Victoria, a transmission hotspot, formed a highly diverse panmictic population. A single round of treatment did not reduce this diversity and there was no indication of a population contraction caused by long-term MDA. We found evidence of positive selection across the genome and while some regions contained members of gene families previously implicated in praziquantel action, no high frequency functionally impactful variants were detected. As efforts to eliminate schistosomiasis intensify, our study provides a foundation for genomic surveillance of this major human parasite.
