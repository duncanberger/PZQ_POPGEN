## Abstract

Efforts to control the parasitic disease schistosomiasis rely on the large-scale administration of the anthelmintic praziquantel. Recent epidemiological studies have shown evidence of reduced praziquantel efficacy in regions of long-term mass drug administration (MDA), which could indicate the emergence of praziquantel resistance. To understand the genomic impact of repeated MDA on Schistosoma mansoni populations, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of parasites sampled from an endemic region with evidence of reduced praziquantel efficacy. In total, WGS data was generated for 198 S. mansoni miracidia sampled from 34 children aged 6â€“12 years attending schools in Uganda with differing past exposure to praziquantel MDA. Population genomic analyses showed that parasites infecting children from schools bordering Lake Victoria, a persistent hotspot for transmission, formed a panmictic and highly diverse population with similar between- and within-host parasite diversity despite geographic separation of several kilometers. Comparison of samples taken before and after administration of praziquantel found no evidence that a single round of treatment reduced this diversity. We found evidence of positive selection in multiple regions across the S. mansoni genome, encompassing genes with previously suggested mechanisms of praziquantel action or resistance including multiple calcium transporters and an ABC transporter gene. As efforts to control schistosomiasis intensify, with an increasing focus on interrupting transmission, this study provides a foundation for population-level genomic surveillance of this major human parasite.
